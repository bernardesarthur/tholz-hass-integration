# Tholz Home Assistant Integration

This integration enables control and monitoring of Tholz Smart devices. The following models have been tested:  

- Tholz Smart Pool v2  
- Tholz Smart Heat v2  

**Key features:**  

- Sensor and binary sensor entities (e.g., header and temperature sensors)  
- Heating entities (water heater control)  
- Switch entities (e.g., pump controls)  

Some entities, such as lights, are still under development and will be added in future updates.  

# Installation

We are working towards making this integration available on HACS. For now, you can add this repository ([https://github.com/felippepuhle/tholz-hass-integration](https://github.com/felippepuhle/tholz-hass-integration)) as a custom repository, selecting the "Integration" type. After that, you can search for "Tholz" and install the integration.  

Once installed, restart Home Assistant. After it comes back online, you can add the integration.
